<para id="fs-id1493420">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">nervous system</term> can be divided into two major subdivisions: the <term id="term-00002">central nervous system (CNS)</term> and the <term id="term-00003">peripheral nervous system (PNS)</term>, shown in <link target-id="CNX_Psych_03_03_NervSystem"/>. The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord; the PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body. In this section, we focus on the peripheral nervous system; later, we look at the brain and spinal cord.</para>

<caption>The nervous system is divided into two major parts: (a) the Central Nervous System and (b) the Peripheral Nervous System.</caption>

<section id="fs-id1422228">
<title>Peripheral Nervous System</title>
<para id="fs-id1547472">The peripheral nervous system is made up of thick bundles of axons, called nerves, carrying messages back and forth between the CNS and the muscles, organs, and senses in the periphery of the body (i.e., everything outside the CNS). The PNS has two major subdivisions: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.</para>
<para id="fs-id1731967">The <term id="term-00004">somatic nervous system</term> is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary. It is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS; therefore, it consists of motor neurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons, carrying instructions from the CNS to the muscles, are efferent fibers (efferent means “moving away from”). Sensory neurons, carrying sensory information to the CNS, are afferent fibers (afferent means “moving toward”). A helpful way to remember this is that <emphasis effect="bold">e</emphasis>fferent = <emphasis effect="bold">e</emphasis>xit and <emphasis effect="bold">a</emphasis>fferent = <emphasis effect="bold">a</emphasis>rrive. Each nerve is basically a bundle of neurons forming a two-way superhighway, containing thousands of axons, both efferent and afferent.</para>
<para id="fs-id1580778">The <term id="term-00005">autonomic nervous system</term> controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be outside the realm of voluntary control. It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions (<link target-id="CNX_Psych_03_03_Autonomic"/>). The <term id="term-00006">sympathetic nervous system</term> is involved in preparing the body for stress-related activities; the <term id="term-00007">parasympathetic nervous system</term> is associated with returning the body to routine, day-to-day operations. The two systems have complementary functions, operating in tandem to maintain the body’s homeostasis. <term id="term-00008">Homeostasis</term> is a state of equilibrium, or balance, in which biological conditions (such as body temperature) are maintained at optimal levels.</para>

<figure id="CNX_Psych_03_03_Autonomic">
<media id="fs-id1729655" alt="A diagram of a human body lists the different functions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic system can constrict pupils, stimulate salivation, slow heart rate, constrict bronchi, stimulate digestion, stimulate bile secretion, and cause the bladder to contract. The sympathetic nervous system can dilate pupils, inhibit salivation, increase heart rate, dilate bronchi, inhibit digestion, stimulate the breakdown of glycogen, stimulate secretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline, and inhibit contraction of the bladder.">

<para id="fs-id1566614">The sympathetic nervous system is activated when we are faced with stressful or high-arousal situations. The activity of this system was adaptive for our ancestors, increasing their chances of survival. Imagine, for example, that one of our early ancestors, out hunting small game, suddenly disturbs a large bear with her cubs. At that moment, the hunter's body undergoes a series of changes—a direct function of sympathetic activation—preparing them to face the threat. The pupils dilate, the heart rate and blood pressure increase, the bladder relaxes, and the liver releases glucose; adrenaline surges into the bloodstream. This constellation of physiological changes, known as the <term id="term-00009">fight or flight response</term>, allows the body access to energy reserves and heightened sensory capacity so that it might fight off a threat or run away to safety.</para>

<para id="fs-id1590023">While it is clear that such a response would be critical for survival for our ancestors, who lived in a world full of real physical threats, many of the high-arousal situations we face in the modern world are more psychological in nature. For example, think about how you feel when you have to stand up and give a presentation in front of a roomful of people, or right before taking a big test. You are in no real physical danger in those situations, and yet you have evolved to respond to a perceived threat with the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">fight or flight</term> response. This kind of response is not nearly as adaptive in the modern world; in fact, we suffer negative health consequences when faced constantly with psychological threats that we can neither fight nor flee. Recent research suggests that an increase in susceptibility to heart disease (Chandola, Brunner, &amp; Marmot, 2006) and impaired function of the immune system (Glaser &amp; Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005) are among the many negative consequences of persistent and repeated exposure to stressful situations. Some of this tendency for stress reactivity can be wired by early experiences of trauma.</para>

<para id="fs-id1523937">Once the threat has been resolved, the parasympathetic nervous system takes over and returns bodily functions to a relaxed state. Our hunter’s heart rate and blood pressure return to normal, the pupils constrict, bladder control is restored, and the liver begins to store glucose in the form of glycogen for future use. These restorative processes are associated with activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.</para>

<title>Summary</title>
<para id="fs-id1505796">The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is comprised of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system transmits sensory and motor signals to and from the central nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls the function of our organs and glands, and can be divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Sympathetic activation prepares us for fight or flight, while parasympathetic activation is associated with normal functioning under relaxed conditions.</para>
