    <para id="eip-852">Most of us suffer from memory failures of one kind or another, and most of us would like to improve our memories so that we don’t forget where we put the car keys or, more importantly, the material we need to know for an exam. In this section, we’ll look at some ways to help you remember better, and at some strategies for more effective studying.</para><section id="fs-idm141776">
        <title>Memory-Enhancing Strategies</title>
    <para id="fs-idm12096000">What are some everyday ways we can improve our memory, including recall? To help make sure information goes from short-term memory to long-term memory, you can use <term id="term-00001">memory-enhancing strategies</term>. One strategy is <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">rehearsal</term>, or the conscious repetition of information to be remembered (Craik &amp; Watkins, 1973). Think about how you learned your multiplication tables as a child. You may recall that 6 x 6 = 36, 6 x 7 = 42, and 6 x 8 = 48. Memorizing these facts is rehearsal.</para><para id="fs-idm1752864">Another strategy is <term id="term-00003">chunking</term>: you organize information into manageable bits or chunks (Bodie, Powers, &amp; Fitch-Hauser, 2006). Chunking is useful when trying to remember information like dates and phone numbers. Instead of trying to remember 5205550467, you remember the number as 520-555-0467. So, if you met an interesting person at a party and you wanted to remember his phone number, you would naturally chunk it, and you could repeat the number over and over, which is the rehearsal strategy.</para>

    <para id="fs-idm22021648">You could also enhance memory by using <term id="term-00004">elaborative rehearsal</term>: a technique in which you think about the meaning of new information and its relation to knowledge already stored in your memory (Tigner, 1999). Elaborative rehearsal involves both linking the information to knowledge already stored and repeating the information. For example, in this case, you could remember that 520 is an area code for Arizona and the person you met is from Arizona. This would help you better remember the 520 prefix. If the information is retained, it goes into long-term memory.</para>
        <para id="fs-idp74523936"><term id="term-00005">Mnemonic devices</term> are memory aids that help us organize information for encoding (<link target-id="Figure_08_04_Knuckles"/>). They are especially useful when we want to recall larger bits of information such as steps, stages, phases, and parts of a system (Bellezza, 1981). Brian needs to learn the order of the planets in the solar system, but he’s having a hard time remembering the correct order. His friend Kelly suggests a mnemonic device that can help him remember. Kelly tells Brian to simply remember the name Mr. VEM J. SUN, and he can easily recall the correct order of the planets: <emphasis>M</emphasis>ercury, <emphasis>V</emphasis>enus, <emphasis>E</emphasis>arth, <emphasis>M</emphasis>ars, <emphasis>J</emphasis>upiter, <emphasis>S</emphasis>aturn, <emphasis>U</emphasis>ranus, and <emphasis>N</emphasis>eptune. You might use a mnemonic device to help you remember someone’s name, a mathematical formula, or the order of mathematical operations.</para><figure id="Figure_08_04_Knuckles"><media id="fs-idp17538192" alt="A photograph shows a person’s two hands clenched into fists so the knuckles show.

		   <para id="fs-idp93557136">Some other strategies that are used to improve memory include expressive writing and saying words aloud. Expressive writing helps boost your short-term memory, particularly if you write about a traumatic experience in your life. Masao Yogo and Shuji Fujihara (2008) had participants write for 20-minute intervals several times per month. The participants were instructed to write about a traumatic experience, their best possible future selves, or a trivial topic. The researchers found that this simple writing task increased short-term memory capacity after five weeks, but only for the participants who wrote about traumatic experiences. Psychologists can’t explain why this writing task works, but it does.</para>

        <para id="fs-idp111637504">What if you want to remember items you need to pick up at the store? Simply say them out loud to yourself. A series of studies (MacLeod, Gopie, Hourihan, Neary, &amp; Ozubko, 2010) found that saying a word out loud improves your memory for the word because it increases the word’s distinctiveness. Feel silly, saying random grocery items aloud? This technique works equally well if you just mouth the words. Using these techniques increased participants’ memory for the words by more than 10%. These techniques can also be used to help you study.</para>

The key with any of these strategies is to figure out what works best for you.</para></section>

    <caption>Memory techniques can be useful when studying for class. (credit: Barry Pousman)</caption></figure><list id="fs-idp11538448"><item><emphasis>Use elaborative rehearsal</emphasis>: In a famous article, Fergus Craik and Robert Lockhart (1972) discussed their belief that information we process more deeply goes into long-term memory. Their theory is called <term id="term-00006">levels of processing</term>. If we want to remember a piece of information, we should think about it more deeply and link it to other information and memories to make it more meaningful. For example, if we are trying to remember that the hippocampus is involved with memory processing, we might envision a hippopotamus with excellent memory and then we could better remember the hippocampus.</item>
<item><emphasis>Apply the self-reference effect</emphasis>: As you go through the process of elaborative rehearsal, it would be even more beneficial to make the material you are trying to memorize personally meaningful to you. In other words, make use of the self-reference effect. Write notes in your own words. Write definitions from the text, and then rewrite them in your own words. Relate the material to something you have already learned for another class, or think how you can apply the concepts to your own life. When you do this, you are building a web of retrieval cues that will help you access the material when you want to remember it.</item>

<item><emphasis>Use distributed practice</emphasis>: Study across time in short durations rather than trying to cram it all in at once. Memory consolidation takes time, and studying across time allows time for memories to consolidate. In addition, cramming can cause the links between concepts to become so active that you get stuck in a link, and it prevents you from accessing the rest of the information that you learned.</item>


<item><emphasis>Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse</emphasis>: Review the material over time, in spaced and organized study sessions. Organize and study your notes, and take practice quizzes/exams. Link the new information to other information you already know well.</item>

<item><emphasis>Study efficiently</emphasis>: Students are great highlighters, but highlighting is not very efficient because students spend too much time studying the things they already learned. Instead of highlighting, use index cards. Write the question on one side and the answer on the other side. When you study, separate your cards into those you got right and those you got wrong. Study the ones you got wrong and keep sorting. Eventually, all your cards will be in the pile you answered correctly.</item>

<item><emphasis>Be aware of interference</emphasis>: To reduce the likelihood of interference, study during a quiet time without interruptions or distractions (like television or music).</item>
<item><emphasis>Keep moving</emphasis>: Of course you already know that exercise is good for your body, but did you also know it’s also good for your mind? Research suggests that regular aerobic exercise (anything that gets your heart rate elevated) is beneficial for memory (van Praag, 2008). Aerobic exercise promotes neurogenesis: the growth of new brain cells in the hippocampus, an area of the brain known to play a role in memory and learning.</item>
<item><emphasis>Get enough sleep</emphasis>: While you are sleeping, your brain is still at work. During sleep the brain organizes and consolidates information to be stored in long-term memory (Abel &amp; Bäuml, 2013).</item>
<item><emphasis>Make use of mnemonic devices</emphasis>: As you learned earlier in this chapter, mnemonic devices often help us to remember and recall information. There are different types of mnemonic devices, such as the acronym. An acronym is a word formed by the first letter of each of the words you want to remember. For example, even if you live near one, you might have difficulty recalling the names of all five Great Lakes. What if I told you to think of the word Homes? HOMES is an acronym that represents Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior: the five Great Lakes. Another type of mnemonic device is an acrostic: you make a phrase of all the first letters of the words. For example, if you are taking a math test and you are having difficulty remembering <emphasis effect="italics">the order of operations</emphasis>, recalling the following sentence will help you: “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,” because the order of mathematical operations is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction. There also are jingles, which are rhyming tunes that contain key words related to the concept, such as <emphasis effect="italics">i before e, except after c</emphasis>.</item>
